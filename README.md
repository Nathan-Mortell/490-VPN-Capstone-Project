# 490-VPN-Capstone-Project-Instructions

This Repo is to show the installation process I did to make my own Portable VPN, what to do if you have to work with an Apple Router, and an optional section on how to (maybe) install an Ad Blocker with the VPN.

## Technologies Used

- Raspberry Pi 5
- Wireguard
- OpenVPN
- Linux
- PiVPN

## Instructional Guide
The first step of this guide is pretty simple, you must first buy a Raspberry Pi. It's up to you if you want to get any of the additional upgrades (like a case or extra mini to HDMI cord). It's mandatory to have have 1 micro to HDMI cord, the power cord, and an SD card with around 16GB (the installation will not use all this space). I would recommend buying the complete bundle on Amazon for $100. Make sure the RAM is at least 8 GB. Make sure you also have a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and the space to set this up; it's essentially a micro-computer. 

When first setting up your Pi, follow the default installation process on screen, I recommend installing the GUI so the installation process will be easier.
